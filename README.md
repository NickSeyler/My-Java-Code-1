# My-Java-Practice #

Java code that was written to sharpen my skills, not only in Java syntax but also in the concepts of object oriented programming.

## Java-Set-1 ##

My first set of java code, and the first code I've ever created. The code consists of simple uses of println, scanner, mathematical expressions.

## Java-Set-2 ##

Utilization of methods and comments and understanding returns and type declarations.

## Java-Set-3 ##

Utilization of if-else statements.

## Java-Set-4 ##

Utilization of switch case, methods from another class (Java's Math class), strings, and string formatting.

## Java-Set-5 ##

Utilization of while loops and for loops, and also nesting loops.

## Java-Set-6 ##

Utilization of arrays and sorting arrays.

Note: StrictlyIdenticalLists.java uses arrays. This code was created before learning that a list in java is a different way to hold data. You should not call your arrays lists.

## Java-Set-7 ##

Utilization of classes by demonstrating creation of objects and using methods from custom classes. Also utilizes overloading constructors, overriding methods, and introduces getters and setters.

## Java-Set-8 ##

Utilization of Array Lists, as well as a custom queue and stack.

## Java-Set-9 ##

Utilization of exceptions and files, and also using arguments via the command line.

Note: Both files in the Calculator folder requires arguments.

Note: CountWords.java links to a URL which is no longer active.

## Java-Set-10 ##

Utilization of javafx and events, and basic UI. 

Note: Oracle dropped javafx from JDK 11 onward.
